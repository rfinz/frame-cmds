# frame-cmds.el
Mirror of `frame-cmds` from Drew Adams on EmacsWiki. `frame-fns.el` is also provided, since it is necessary for `frame-cmds` to run.

These two libraries are copied from emacswiki.org from Drew's admin-locked files, compiled and checked for regressions or other disturbances in the code, and then uploaded to this location. As such, this code may be several days behind the latest and greatest at https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/frame-cmds.el
